# Business Strategy & Executive Stakeholder Notes

## 1. The Stakeholder Philosophy: Impact and Value
**Focus:** It is not about hard work; it is about strategic alignment and solving the right problems.

* **The O3 Framework:**
    * **Outcome:** What results—specifically with numbers—do we get?
    * **Objective:** What specific part of the business does it improve?
    * **Obstacle:** What pain does it remove?
* **Visibility & Influence:** Visibility is a strategic tool to get what you want.
* **Performance vs. Potential:** A critical distinction—Executives do not reward performance; they reward **Potential**.
* **Ownership & Leadership:** You must see the bigger picture and take full ownership.

## 2. Strategic Questioning & Engagement
Don't just provide information; provide insight. To demonstrate skills for the next career level, turn information into insights by answering:
1.  **What does it mean?**
2.  **Why does it matter?**
3.  **What should we do next?**

### Questioning Categories:
* **Outcome Focused:** Explicitly link effort to a clear business result. (e.g., "How will this impact revenue and business cost?")
* **Prioritization Focused:** Help to clarify what truly matters to the organization.
* **Risk/Trade-off Oriented:** Show you are forward-thinking by addressing the "downside" or what is being sacrificed.

## 3. The Leverage Zone & Momentum
* **The Leverage Zone:** Position your work so that leadership values it, ensuring appreciation leads to reward.
* **Strategy Formula:** `What you did + What outcome + What problem it avoided`
* **Signal vs. Noise:** Focus on what actually matters.
    * **Action:** Delegate, challenge if it needs to be done, or take it on.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** After the meeting, do not ask "any questions?" Instead, say: 
    > “Now that we are aligned with the outcome, I will take action and come back to you.”

## 4. Promotion & Executive "Yes" Framework
**Getting the Promotion:** Requires a mix of Timing, Negotiation, and Strategy. Ask what the priority projects are, document your contribution, and update leadership regularly for influence.

### To get an Executive to say "Yes," the plan must be:
1.  **Achievable:** Based on past success + a proven formula and structure.
2.  **Desirable.**
3.  **Acceptable:** Avoid being too technical. Communicate effectively to ensure ideas are not stolen.

## 5. Executive Leadership Styles (Communication Matrix)
Tailor your communication style to the executive's values:

* **RED:** Values execution and visible results.
* **GREEN:** Values predictable outcomes and constant momentum.
* **BLUE:** Values strong reasoning and analysis.
* **YELLOW:** Values innovative solutions and new ideas.
