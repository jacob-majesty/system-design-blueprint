### **Technical Communication & Recall Strategy**

*   **Document Everything:** Assume you'll forget. Use clear commit messages, PR descriptions, and internal notes.
*   **Create a "Mini-Brief":** Before a code review, jot down:
    *   Problem & High-Level Solution
    *   Why this approach?
    *   Key edge cases
    *   Step-by-step code flow
*   **Explain at Two Levels:**
    *   **High-Level:** What it does and why.
    *   **Low-Level:** How it works internally.
*   **Handle Unknowns Professionally:**
    *   "I don't recall the exact detail, but I can walk through the reasoning or pull up the code."
*   **Acknowledge Collaboration:**
    *   "I paired with [Teammate] on this; here is my understanding..." This shows confidence and honesty.
